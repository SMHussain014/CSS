As you know, we have already learned about background-image: url() property.
In this lecture, we are about to learn:
    (i) linear-gradient()
    (ii) repeating-linear-gradient()
    (iii) radial-gradient()
    (iv) repeating-radial-gradient()
    (v) Conic-gradient()

Background-image: linear-gradient() and repeating-linear-gradient()
The smooth combination of two or more colors is called gradient. 
It functions on background-image property.
Linear Gradient produces horizontal design. Repeating Linear Gradient produces diagonal design.
Its default position is top to bottom. Its position can be changed, i.e from bottom to top, like 
background-image: linear-gradient(to top, red, green) 
Its mean, we have to provide only end position or direction. The allowed positions are top, bottom,
left, right, bottom right, top right, bottom left, top left etc.
It can be applied in degrees also, like background-image: linear-gradient(45 deg, red, green) 
Multiple colors and their percentage can also be given. 'rgba can also be applied, like
background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(255, 0, 0, 1), rgba(255, 0, 0, 0)) 
We can repeat these colors, like background-image: repeating linear-gradient(to left, red, green 10%, yellow 20%) 

Background-image: radial-gradient() and repeating-radial-gradient()
These produces circular shaped with colors. The color flow is from centre to outwards direction.
Its default shape is oval, other shapes like circle, ellipse etc may be given, e.g.
background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red 40%, yellow 30%, green 30%) 
Like linear-gradient, the shape's positions can be applied, e.g.
background-image: radial-gradient(circle at left, red 40%, yellow 30%, green 30%) 
It can be used in  percentage, like
background-image: radial-gradient(circle at 10%, red 40%, yellow 30%, green 30%) 
Transparent color can also be used, like
background-image: radial-gradient(ellipse at left, red, transparent) 
Its position can be adjusted with the help of attributes, like closest-side, farthest-side, closest-corner and farthest-corner.
background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 30%. red, blue, green) 
We can repeat these colors, like background-image: repeating radial-gradient(red, green 10%, yellow 20%) 

Background-image: conic-gradient()
It is similar to radial-gradient. It can be applied at any angle and at any percentage, like 
background-image: conic-gradient(from 45 deg, red, blue, green) 
If opening and closing colors are same no visible line can be seen.
The centre of conic can also be changed, like
background-image: conic-gradient(at 20% 45%, red, blue, green) 
It can be repeated like that background-image: repeating conic-gradient(red 10 deg, blue 20 deg, green 10 deg) 
If we fixed background-size of x and y, we will have beautiful checks like shape.
