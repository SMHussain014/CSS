How to use CSS:
Inline CSS;
1.  To use inline CSS, use 'style' attribute in desired tag.
2.  Write name of property, you want to use, select property and close it; e.g.
    <h1 style="color:red;">

In-Page CSS:
3.  To use in-page CSS, use 'style' tag between opening and closing 'head' or 'body' tags.
4.  It can be used in 'head' or 'body' tags yet its usage in 'body' tag is recommended.
    For example:
    <style>
        h2{
            color:red;
            background:green;
        }
    </style>
5.  The 'style' tag has two types or attributes namely 'text' and 'media' which we will study in 
    upcoming lectures.

    Source CSS;
6.  To use source CSS, create a file with extension '.scc' and write the code within it like 
    at S.N.4 above.
7.  To run CSS, this style-sheet has to be linked with desired HTML file, like:
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=file_name.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="media/css" href=file_name.css">
8.  Note that above inline tag 'link' is written between opening and closing 'head' tags of 
    HTML file.
