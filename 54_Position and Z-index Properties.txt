Position Properties:
It has four value, i.e. static, relative, fixed and absolute. Its default value is static.
These values have four attributes, like left, right, top, bottom (used in pixels).
To use this property, we have to make a parent division and within that its child divisions.
The relative position works as per its parent division.
The fixed position places a division onto a fixed position and it works as per root or HTML. 
The absolute position works in relation to parent-child divisions, in such a way that parent 
division remains fixed (if its position is set to 'relative') and well within that absolute 
position of child is set. (In fact, absolute position is used in both divisions). 
If parent division is not set to relative, it works as per whole page, i.e. HTML or root.

Sticky Position:
It can be used in nav tag like that 'position:Sticky; and top:-5px;'. 
It will freeze the nav tag at that position.

Z-index Property:
It is used to display two or more divisions in front and back of each other.
It has two values, auto (default value) and number value, i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc.
Note the higher number will be displayed at front.
It should be used with absolute position property.
