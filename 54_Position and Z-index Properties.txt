Position Properties:
It has four value, i.e. static, relative, fixed and absolute. Its default value is static. 
The relative position may be used with attributes, like left, right, top, bottom etc and their
values in pixels. 
The fixed position places first division or image onto second one. 
The absolute position works in relation to both divisions, in such a way that first div remains 
fixed and well within second div. (In fact, absolute position is used in both divisions)

Z-index Property:
It is used to display two or more divisions in front and back of each other.
It has two values, auto (default value) and number value, i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc.
Note the higher number will be displayed at front.
It should be used with absolute position property.
