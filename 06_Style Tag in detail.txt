Attribute 'text' controls the text's color, text's background, text's border and 
page background's color.
It is written within opening 'style' tag; like <style type="text/css">
Attribute 'media' controls screen and print options of a webpage.
It is written within opening 'style' tag for screen; like 
<style type="text/CSS" media="screen and (max-width:900px)">
It is written within opening 'style' tag for print; like 
<style type="text/CSS" media="print">
